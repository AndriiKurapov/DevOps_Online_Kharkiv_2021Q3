## Task 2
Simulate the corporate network that contains one
house with four floors. 
The horizontal subsystem of the floor consists of two working groups on 3 and 5 computers accordingly. 
Divide the network on eight subnets,analyze network performance and traffic.

All PC's can communicate with each other
## Task 3
Simulate the local network of 5 buildings with 1 floor.
One building - 1 working group of 6 computers. 
The network is being built based on a router with one WAN port.

Static routing on Router0

Static routing on Internet router

![](Screenshots/Screen14.png)

Routers connected via Serial cable with IPâ€™s:
10.0.0.1 for Router0
10.0.0.2 for Internet Router

Network setup (IP and gateway assignment) is similar to previous tasks

Web-Server has 126.0.0.1 IP-address and 126.0.0.2 gateway on router

Applied static routing allows all PC's communicate with each other, but only 1st network can access to web-server

Let's see if it works
